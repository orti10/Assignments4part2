# About the Project:
*Master mind=Bull pgia
Mastermind or Master Mind is a code-breaking game for two players. The modern game with pegs was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli (!!!) postmaster and telecommunications expert.It resembles an earlier pencil and paper game called Bulls and Cows that may date back a century or more.
we create here an automatic player that guess the answer in the game "Bull And Pgia" in really few turns. (Less then 10 untill 7 and  really good result above 7).

# The rules 👾:
Bull = good guess :+1: , good position :+1:  
Pgia = good guess :+1: , bad position :-1:
